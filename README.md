Nft-App - One of my first Apps on Swift by using an API . This is a app writen in Swift using Xcode. It use an API that includes data about NFTs that the are shown on the app . It includes custom TableViewCells class that "generates" the cells and it also inclue some ViewControllers such as the LobbyViewController (Main VC) the PresentViewController and others .
